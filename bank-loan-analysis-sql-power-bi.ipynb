(86.2%) were classified as good loans, with 33K applications, 370M funded, and 436M received. Conversely, bad loans accounted for 13.8% of issued loans, with 5K applications, 66M funded, and 37M received. This highlights the importance of robust risk assessment and credit evaluation processes to minimize loan defaults.\n\n- Average Loan Amount by Income Bracket: Analysis by income brackets revealed that borrowers with higher incomes tended to apply for and receive larger loan amounts. Specifically, average loan amounts were around 2K for low-income borrowers, 11K for medium-income borrowers, and 18K for high-income borrowers, underscoring income disparities in borrowing behavior. Develop targeted marketing strategies to attract borrowers across different income brackets, ensuring equitable access to lending opportunities while optimizing loan profitability.\n\n- Application Trends: The number of loan applications demonstrated a gradual increase over the months, with January recording the lowest volume (2K applications) and December the highest (4K applications). Understanding these seasonal trends can inform resource allocation and staffing decisions to manage fluctuating application volumes effectively.\n\n- Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation: Establish regular monitoring and evaluation processes to track lending performance metrics and identify emerging trends or areas requiring intervention, facilitating proactive decision-making and risk management.","metadata":{}}]}
